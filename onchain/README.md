## Getting Started

```sh
$ bun install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
```

## Features

## Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
    - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

```sh
$  forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url xxx --broadcast --verify --legacy --ffi
```

```sh
$ forge script script/MugenToken.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url <RPC_URL> --etherscan-api-key <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>  --verify
```
