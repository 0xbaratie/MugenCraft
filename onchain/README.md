## Getting Started

```sh
$ bun install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
```

## Features

## Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
   - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

## Usage

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

```sh
$  forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url xxx --broadcast --verify --legacy --ffi
```

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

```

### Test

Run the tests:

$ forge test
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh

simply copy paste the path):

```sh
$ bun run test:coverage:report
```
